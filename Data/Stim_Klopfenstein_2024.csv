  Strata.
 

  What's on top of the writing?  What's below it?  What ink was used?  How old is the wood found above it?  How long are the stalactites around it or over it?
 

  Everything in terms of data has to do with determining a window of time, not an exact time, given what you know must have occurred earlier and what must have occurred later.  If they're using a particular ink that isn't in common use until a certain date, and that date was itself determined by an example over which a tree grew or a stalactite formed.  And you can date that tree or stalactite, which gives you an upper or lower bound on the date.
 

  Strata, layers.  It must have happened AFTER this but BEFORE this, and you compare against databases over thousands of sites to check it's all consistent.

  The cortical reaction! 
To ELI5 it:
First, you need to know that egg cells are surrounded by a thick layer of jelly-like goop (Zona Pellucida) Sperm cells have to burrow through that goop to actually reach the egg itself. The first sperm to make it through the goop to the egg sends its genetic information into the egg cell. This triggers a kind of intruder alarm, which releases chemicals (enzymes) that turn the jelly-goop into a hard, thick shell. Any sperm that was still in the goop is now trapped, and any sperm that is late to the party has found the door closed. This makes sure that only one sperm can actually make it to the egg.

  An acid burn results in something called coagulative necrosis, which basically means it kills the cells but leaves their bodies behind in a mushy layer. This new mushy layer actually can prevent the acid from penetrating into deeper tissues and causing more damage.
 

  An alkali (base) burn results in liquefactive necrosis, which means that it melts your cells and clears the way to your spongy insides to do more damage.
 

  The difference is that acid reacts with proteins and base will react with fats.

  The chemicals in your eyes are only sensitive to narrow wavelengths of visual light.  Anything outside that is invisible to us.

  You have sinuses in your cheeks and forehead which are hollow spaces in the skull. They secrete small amounts of thin mucous that normally drains through some narrow passageways into the nose, they clear out debris that you inhale, and most of it goes down your throat and you swallow it.
 

  When you have sinus congestion it’s because the passageways are inflamed and narrowed (can be from allergies or infection) and the mucous can’t exit, builds up, and increases pressure which causes an uncomfortable sensation in your head and cheeks. Repositioning or inhaling steam can help encourage the passageways to open up the tiniest bit and relieve some of the pressure.

  File compression saves hard drive space by removing redundant data.
 

  For example take a 500 page book and scan through it to find the 3 most commonly used words.
 

  Then replace those words with place holders so 'the' becomes $, etc
 

  Put an index at the front of the book that translates those symbols to words.
 

  Now the book contains exactly the same information as before, but now it's a couple dozen pages shorter. This is the basics of how file compression works. You find duplicate data in a file and replace it with pointers.
 

  The upside is reduced space usage, the downside is your processor has to work harder to

  The entire radio spectrum is ""noisy""--there's interference in it from both man-made sources and natural ones (e.g. lightning strikes). If you tune the radio to a dead channel then all it will be picking up is that noise, which it amplifies and turns into the static that you hear. You still get the noise on actual radio channels, but it gets drowned out by the radio station you're tuned in to so you tend not to notice unless it's very bad.

  Early jet engines were actually quite inefficient compared to what we have today. Not painting the exterior was one way to shave off a surprising amount of unnecessary weight and thus save fuel and increase payload. Paint is surprisingly heavy and, while this was primarily done to military aircraft, the weight saving on commercial passenger jets was considerable, think 100s of kg each.
 

  The trade off. Of course, was that this increased maintenance costs but as early jet aircraft had fairly simple airframes this was acceptable. Modern airframes are considerably more complex and whilst less easy to damage they are much more expensive to maintain. This flips the trade off firmly in favour of pained exteriors in every case.

  If you'd leave the cutting in the same water for some time, the water will get depleted of oxygen, bacteria and fungi will grow and it would infect the cutting. So, essentially the same thing as with root rot in soil would happen.
 

  The difference to a hydroponic system (as others already pointed out), is that the water in a hydro system is constantly agitated (with pumps, bubblers etc.) and thus enriched with oxygen. This way the water doesn't get ""stale"" and harmful microorganism won't grow.

  The difference to a hydroponic system (as others already pointed out), is that the water in a hydro system is constantly agitated (with pumps, bubblers etc.) and thus enriched with oxygen. This way the water doesn't get ""stale"" and harmful microorganism won't grow.

  If you'd leave the cutting in the same water for some time, the water will get depleted of oxygen, bacteria and fungi will grow and it would infect the cutting. So, essentially the same thing as with root rot in soil would happen.

  There's an old adage that ""the dose makes the poison"". Everything is toxic in sufficient quantity. You can poison yourself to death with water if you drink enough in a short period of time (there have been several examples of this).
 

  The reason Botox treatment doesn't kill you is because they don't inject enough to kill you. It's still toxic, it works by paralyzing the targeted muscles, but the dose is small enough that some muscle paralysis is (hopefully) the only bad effect.

  There is a lot of interesting stuff that the human eye can't see. A billowing nebula of hydrogen and helium gas slowly collapsing to form a new star is really cool!
 

  But, it would be too dim for the human eye to see so it would just be black. So we up the brightness. But also the human eye can't see sparse gas against vacuum, and it can't see the frequencies of light required to distinguish between hydrogen and helium. So we shift the frequency into something in visible light, effectively picking a color to represent each gas.
 

  At the end you have an image that doesn't really represent what the naked eye could view. But it would also be pretty silly to say ""Check out this image from my infrared camera!"" and hand you a blank sheet of paper because you can't see infrared light.

  Both these words come from Old English. They were written as “hus” and “mus” back then, and the plurals were “hus” and “mys”. That is, the plural for “hus” was the same as singular, while the plural for “mus” changed the vowel. This difference in plurals is due to the fact that Old English was a gendered language, and while “mus” was a feminine noun (basically like we call a ship “she” today), “hus” was neuter. Nouns of different gender had different plural formation rules. Eventually English invented the new plural formation rule (by adding -s at the end of a word), but didn’t apply it to some feminine nouns like “mus”/“mouse” which retained their old plurals. Then English nouns lost their gender, and the vowels in words changed rather uniformly during the linguistic event called “The Great Vowel Shift”.

  They can. But only at very specific spots and, since your ears capture sound over an area, they can't completely make you not hear it.
 

  If you have a pure sine wave signal (a pure tone) and broadcast the exact opposite, you will indeed cancel to exactly zero wherever the loudness (amplitude) and alignement (phase) of the reversed wave exactly opposes the incoming wave. Assuming that the cancelling signal is louder than the incoming signal, this will always happen *somewhere*. But it'll be a very small region.
 

  Your eardrum is a whole area so you can't cancel the incoming signal across your whole ear, so some will get through, so you'll always hear some of it.

  A single wheel makes the wheelbarrow easier to turn in tight spaces. Anecdotally, they're also much easier to push up hills than a two-wheeled wheelbarrow. Two wheels also deal with uneven terrain more poorly than single wheel designs.
 

  A wheelbarrow tipping over is actually beneficial as well, as it makes them easier to empty.

  So it's both. 2000 big Calories (which is the actual measurement everyone is used to dealing with), 2 million small calories (which is arguably more true to the definitions, but nobody outside of particularly ornery chemists has any real use for the unit). Since nobody really uses the small calorie for anything, people don't know/forget they're two different things and also get sloppy about distinguishing between the two.

  Running cable underground is more expensive typically and can be more difficult to install / replace if damaged. But in theory it's a great idea for areas which are prone to high winds.

  I haven't seen any explanations that answer the actual question, and as an aerospace engineer and car enthusiast, I'm gonna change that.
 

  Larger tires DON'T provide more grip. Due to the increased weight, they ALSO slow you down.
 

  So why are they used?
 

  Because the amount of friction sticky tire compounds provide is larger than a small tire's shear failure point.
 

  Bits of tire are always left behind, but you'd be leaving actual chunks if your tires weren't larger.
 

  Maximum shear is directly proportional to area. Wider tire? More area for the shear.
 

  The effect of not overpowering the tire's failure modes means you can effectively have more grip. You can get more of that friction into something usable, which means you can handle and accelerate harder.

  Don't confuse the two - energy is not equal to force. For a given force, the time taken to decelerate from 100 to 50 is the same as 50 to 0. But in that time, the vehicle travels much further in the faster car than the slower car, therefore the energy expended is much higher.

  Each switch can represent a single bit of information. An SD card has billions of these tiny switches that can be turned on or off.

  Celtic is a Latin word (Celtae) from Greek (Κελτοί—Keltoi). In classical Latin, all Cs are hard. However, later forms of Latin (e.g. ecclesiastical Latin) softened the C. So a name like Caesar pronounced in classical Latin is Kaesar while in ecclesiastical Latin it is pronounced Saesar.
 

  For whatever reasons, the basketball team decided to use the ecclesiastical pronunciation. Modern English typically does, and perhaps more so back in the 1940s when the team was founded. However, people instead chose to use the classical pronunciation when referring to the linguistic group of people. Perhaps they wanted that name to reflect what the Romans that named them. If there is an exact socio-cultural reason aside form arbitrary choice, I am not familiar with it. Perhaps an etymologist or linguist can chime in and some more history behind this.

  I often color old black-and-white photographs as a hobby and, most of the time, you just have to guess when you colorize an image.
 

  Sometimes, for famous people, you can do historical research to find out the color of their hair and eyes or even their homes' furnishings (for instance, Empress Alexandra Feodorovna had reddish gold hair and blue eyes and her mauve boudoir was all lavender with pistachio green carpets). You can also do research to get a general idea of the kinds of colors that were popular, say, in the Victorian or Edwardian eras... but that's pretty much it.

  There are two big problems we face here.
 

  The first is that lightning is unpredictable - we would be investing in a system that might occasionally help, but equally might do next to nothing for long periods and overall end up costing money to maintain without generating many gains.
 

  The second is that we just don't really have the technology to capture and store that amount of electricity quickly enough. Those car batteries that take 20 minutes to charge with a fast charger? We are talking about needing a way to capture and store multiple times that amount of energy in a fraction of a second. The current technology we have just doesn't work that quickly.

  I am a gastroenterologist. The prep you take works by pushing stool out mechanically. Much like a drano does with a clog.
 

  However polyethylene glycol (and most osmotic laxatives) also prevents the absorption of water by your large intestine. So all that liquid that you drink stays inside the intestine and causes diarrhea rather than excessive urination.
 

  On a side note, Make sure to take your prep until the stool is consistently water and fairly clear. In adults if you aren’t cleaned out there is no point in doing the colonoscopy (particularly if they are looking for cancer) so you will have to go through the process again.

  On a side note, Make sure to take your prep until the stool is consistently water and fairly clear. In adults if you aren’t cleaned out there is no point in doing the colonoscopy (particularly if they are looking for cancer) so you will have to go through the process again.

  The fact that we developed civilisation when we did is due to a factor of our intelligence, luck in our biology (elephant and dolphins are extremely smart, but don’t have the bodies for tools and fire) and a whole lot of time.

  Headache pain results from nerves sending pain signals to the brain; the exact nature depends on the kind of headache, but the most common are:
 


   Tension headaches. No single cause, but in some people they tend to originate in tightened muscles in the back of the neck and scalp. There are two types: episodic (fewer than 15 days per month) and chronic (more than 15 days)
  

   Migraine. The cause of these is not yet known, but is believed to be linked to changes in the brain and genetic factors. Currently the best guess is that overactive nerve cells send out a signal that triggers the trigeminal nerve, triggering the release of chemicals that cause your brain lining's blood vessels to swell.
  

   Cluster. Similar to migraine. They're more common in smokers or heavy drinkers. They also reach their full force a lot more quickly, and are somewhat predictable based on your body clock.

  Plants have the ability of sensing gravity and orienting themselves accordingly. This is called gravitropism. In the roots, there are some small pouches in the cells which produce and store starch and basically pull down the roots through some specialized signaling mechanisms. Roots have positive gravitropism (they grow towards higher gravity) and stems have the opposite.
 

  Additionally, both roots and stems orient themselves according to the amount of light. This is called phototropism. Stems are attracted by the light (phototropism), while roots are repelled by it.

  If you try playing guitar the opposite way it becomes pretty obvious that the strumming is actually the more difficult part. Much of the time you’re just forming your off hand into the correct fret positions to play chords. Even if you’re playing more melodically or a solo, it’s less difficult than you’d think to move your fingers around, and you have the neck to guide that hand if need be. 
Strumming and picking end up taking more control and effort so your dominant hand is better at it.

    The brain is capable of rejecting information from sources that wildly contradicts its current world model.

  Swelling results from capillary leakage, which itself results from the release of inflammatory compounds at the site of injury.  The fluid can become what's called organized, in which proteins in the fluid, like fibrin, accumulate, and this can make the swelling permanent to some degree.  Does the swelling serve any purpose?  The capillary leakage also lets white blood cells into the damaged area, and these control infection and gobble up debris (by Pac Man-type cells called macrophages) from the injury, so I think the answer is yes.  But getting rid of the swelling within a week is a good idea, as the infection control and gobbling up of debris is done by that time as well.

  Cells aren't being regenerated from some magic template. The cells in a spot are the ones that replace themselves. Your current skin makes the new skin. The scar isn't ""broken"". It's a different construction of skin cells. Your body used it to replace literal missing tissue. Those cells belong there now. And they replace themselves when they need to with copies of themselves.

  A racetrack is oversimplified. More realistically, all the veins, arteries, capillaries, etc are like a giant neighborhood, not strictly a circle with only one way to do it. So you have a fleet of mail people delivering to all those houses, and if a section of the neighborhood gets cut off, all the packages can still be delivered to all the houses that haven't been cut off via all the other connecting streets. The main supply and return veins and arteries have hundreds of thousands of branches where blood can flow between those main lines.

  Eye color=what kind of colored stuff is in the eye+how the eye scatters light. The first part is easy. The human body makes melanin, the same pigment that determines skin color, and the iris of your eye has more or less of it. Lots of melanin=brown or black eyes, end of story. There are other pigments that can contribute to amber or dark green eyes.
 

  The other part is weirder. It comes down to how light is scattered by fibers in the iris. This is the same kind of physics that explains why the sky is blue, why skim milk looks kinda blue, or why some bird feathers are colorful even though they don't have any coloring in them. If there's not much melanin or other pigment, then this explains more of the lighter colors like blue and green.

  Ice cores. Where you drill a big hole in the ice and pull out samples.
 

  When Ice freezes, it traps tons of little air bubbles in it. These little air bubbles have the same composition of the overall atmosphere when that sections of ice froze.
 

  So, if you were to go somewhere like Antarctica, and drill down hundreds of feet, you would get to ice that formed a long long time ago, thousands and even hundreds of thousands of years for the deepest cores.
 

  You now have ice that froze a long time ago, and trapped a sample of the atmosphere from that time in it. You have a sample literally frozen in time.
 

  You can then take that to a lab and do an analysis of how much CO2, Methane, O2, and other gasses are present and compare that to levels we see today and from other younger or older ice cores.

  It's a bit unintuitive, but that's not exactly how it ends up working.
 

  A more densely packed, smaller CPU design made out of smaller individual transistors is actually more power efficient. It suffers less electrical losses, and so it generates less heat. The performance and efficiency benefits to going smaller generally far outweigh any consequent heat dissipation issues that might be caused by the increased density. Removing heat from the die isn't that big a problem anyway.

  No literally, moisturizing soaps generally use glycerine (also called glycerol) as the moisturizing agent and it leaves a film on your skin which both traps moisture evaporating from your skin and attracts moisture from the air being an hygroscopic chemical.

  Further simplifying, in the soap formulation there is a chemical that both keeps moisture in and pulls moisture from air so your skin remains moist.

  Out bodies tend to twist when we walk, even moreso down near the waist, where that bottom button is.  A horizontal button hole is able to handle more stress from that twisting motion, and since it's (usually) hidden inside pants anyway, it is made horizontal, so that the button is less likely to break off.

Despite all of that twisting motion of our bodies, the buttons always end up generally centered over the slits, rather than always sliding to one side or the other and looking ""off.""

  Voltage isn't exactly constant.  A cell phone battery might be rated at 3.7 volts, but really it's 3.8V when it's fully charged, and 3.5V when it's empty.
 

  The phone then has (more or less) a look-up table.  The phone knows that when it's at 3.8V, it's 100% charged.  And when it's at 3.75V it's 80% charged, etc.  This is also why old phones sometimes go from 20% charged to 0% charged almost instantly - because the battery is old and isn't performing according to the lookup table.

  Voltage isn't exactly constant.  A cell phone battery might be rated at 3.7 volts, but really it's 3.8V when it's fully charged, and 3.5V when it's empty.
 </p>
 <p>
  The phone then has (more or less) a look-up table.  The phone knows that when it's at 3.8V, it's 100% charged.  And when it's at 3.75V it's 80% charged, etc.  This is also why old phones sometimes go from 20% charged to 0% charged almost instantly - because the battery is old and isn't performing according to the lookup table.

  The vast majority of the energy that a dishwasher uses goes towards heating the water. The sprayer pumps use very little power in comparison.
 

  So the best way to reduce the overall energy consumption is to lower the water temperature, which makes the cleaning cycle take longer, but that's fine because only the low power pumps are running during that time.

  Not an expert but I asked the question before and the answer I had was this.
 

  The brain of the bird is made to mostly perceive movements (like the raptors in Jurassic Park). So in order to see those movements they try to stay still most of the time. When they have to move, they will move most of their body and keep the head at the same place so that they can still perceive movement in reference to them. Then they will quickly readjust when they can't do that anymore, giving that weird look when they do.

At higher altitudes there is a big difference in the chemistry due to the sunlight, so the effects of density are not really seen by comparison.

  A big part has to do with the human body being very energy efficient. Muscle tissue eats up a lot of calories. When you are inactive for extended periods of time, your body decreases your muscle volume because there’s no reason to burn the extra calories to sustain it. Your lung capacity also goes down and your heart becomes weaker, decreasing the oxygen intake that powers your bodily functions.
 

  There’s also a good chance you’re eating poorly and/or eating too much, so you’re packing on the fat and losing nutrients, which adds on weight that you no longer have muscles to support and throws off your body chemistry.
 

  The next time you try to be active, even doing small things like walking across the room, you get tired much faster.
 

  There’s also a lot of changes in brain chemistry and oversleeping messes with your circadian rhythm, but I’m not entirely confident in explaining that.

729,quvdmf,why does water get louder as it gets hotter and then quieter once it's actually boiling?,<p>why does water get louder as it gets hotter and then quieter once it's actually boiling?</p>,639,hkta9g7,"

  When water boils, it's getting so hot that parts of it are becoming a gas, pushing the rest of the water away and rising up in bubbles to escape as steam.
 

  As you heat a pot of water from the bottom, the bottom layers get hot enough to boil first. Bubbles of steam form and rise into the relatively cooler water.

  One theory that I like says that the reason for the universe's expansion is that dark energy is a fundamental property of spacetime. It's the nature of space to grow, and as it does, there exists more space which also has its own dark energy.
 

  In this way, space expands faster and faster as more space comes into existence. It increases in volume forever while all the matter and energy inside is gradually pulled apart.

In an unfinished house there is only the studs which will dry quickly because they are exposed to sunlight and lots of air while this might cause some warping everything is held togeather and doesn't really move. Now if you get water into a finished basement you now have water in the walls in the carpet or under the floor. Air cant get to these places so they stay wet for long periods of time and that causes problems. There are also materials that don't do well when wet regardless of how long they are wet for and those don't go in till after the house is water tight.

  Yes, they do have explosives strapped to the exterior! It's called. Explosive reactive armor. Anti-tank weapons most often employ what is called a shaped charge, which is an explosive device that is shaped in a way to focus the blast energy. Think of it like using a magnifying glass to burn paper, focusing the energy in one small area increases the penetrative power of the Anti-tank weapon. To counteract shaped charges, explosive reactive armor is deployed. The explosive reactive armor detonated when hit, and the shock wave disrupts the focused energy of the shaped charge. While yes this obviously causes some minimal damage to the exterior of the tank, it provides far greater protection than not having it. Also, it allows the tanks to be lighter, move faster, and this be harder to hit

  Concrete is good in compression, but terrible in tension- it’s relatively weak and when it fails it normally fails by snapping without any warning.
 

  Steel is good in tension - it has a high tensile strength and when it fails it stretches for a bit first, so you see things bending and sagging in a bad way before it falls down, giving you time to GTFO.
 

  So you can take a concrete beam/slab and stick steel bars in the areas that are going to be in tension. When you load up the beams/floors the concrete cracks a little and then the steel carries the tension.
 

  This lets you have a structure with the concrete working in compression, which it is good at, and the steel working in tension, which it is good at.

  First of, when ice freezes, it's usually the flat surface you walk on. It's just really, really flat. Like, a road has tiny bumps and irregularities that cause friction, but a still water surface is completely flat, and so is the water when it freezes.
 

  Secondly, ice is a grid of water atoms. If you squeeze it by walking on it, some of it ""collapses"" into water, creating a thin layer of water that has even less friction. We use that for ice skating, for example, but that also makes walking on ice even worse.

  Waves are not current.  Waves are really just pulses of energy and can pass through each other.  They are mostly generated by wind.  They can reflect and refract like light.
 

  In the middle of the ocean, most of the waves travel in the direction of the wind.  When the wind changes direction, the already generated waves will keep traveling in the same direction (and will eventually dissipate) and it will start generating waves in a different direction.  As a result, the open ocean has sets of waves traveling in several directions.  Form the perspective of a small boat, there will be a main swell and then ""under"" it, you can usually notice secondary swells traveling in different directions.
 

  Waves go slower in shallower water.  Like light entering a lens, this causes the waves to turn towards shore.  As a result, any waves traveling at an angle towards the beach will get steered straight towards it.

Why (probably) can't we get the same health benefits from dry herbs?</p>,306,h2784zh,"

  You can (and many people do) chew fresh herbs, either for their taste or their perceived health benefit.
 

  But fresh herbs only stay fresh for a very short time after being picked. Within a couple of days they're usually starting to go limp, to lose some of their flavour, and generally to be less desirable.
 

  So the answer to that is to dry the herbs and distribute them in their dried form. But then they're quite unpalatable: putting a handful of dried herbs into your mouth is not far different from shoving in a handful of sawdust!
 

  However if you steep the dried herbs in hot water for a few minutes, you get a reasonable compromise: a product that can be easily distributed and stored for months, along with an experience for the consumer of something that tastes good and isn't unpleasant.

  The exact reasons why flu does exactly what it does have never been totally confirmed. The basic answer is that flu doesn't totally go away, it just circulates at much lower levels. Other things we do know:
 

  *Each hemisphere has flu season in its colder months (summer in the U.S. is winter+flu season in Australia, summer in Australia is winter+flu season in the U.S.) Flu seems to spread better when people are stuck indoors in dry cold air.
 

  *The influenza virus has a bunch of different strains, which can evade the immune response to other strains. Each season, one strain breaks out and becomes predominant.
 

  *Every few decades or so, a radically new strain shows up, as flu can do some weird genetic shuffling that makes something our immune systems haven't seen before. The new strain can set off a pandemic, then later become one more of the usual cast of circulating strains.

  The sun provides (at peak) about 1300 Watts of heat per square meter of area.  So, even in the winter when the sun is lower (therefore the angle  of incidence is lower, and less heat will be absorbed) you could still be getting a few hundred Watts of heat just by being in the sun.  Quite honestly, 60 F (15C) and direct sun is usually uncomfortably warm for me.  Go stand in front of a 1000 W electric heater and see!

  Submarine-based missiles have a few major advantages.
 


   They can be launched very close to their destination. A missile hitting Pyong Yang from the Sea of Japan takes a lot less time than one fired from Guam, simply due to range. This gives the enemy a lot less time to detect and retaliate.
  

   Since they are mobile and hidden, they cannot effectively be targeted by your enemies. In theory, an enemy could knock out any number of land-based missile launchers, since they are hard to hide and cannot move.
  

   They guarantee the ability to retaliate. This is part of the mutually-assured-destruction nuclear deterrent. If you strike an enemy and take them out with no chance of retaliation, then there's very little stopping you from doing it. If they have a sub that could launch a retaliatory strike afterwards, you have to weigh that risk.

  The Apollo space suits were fine for what they were. They lasted 3 days worth of moonwalks. (About 7 hours each moonwalk).
 

  By the time Cernan and Schmitt were leaving the moon from Apollo 17, their suits were torn, grit filled, and probably would not have lasted another days moonwalk. The suits were fine for the mission, but not for an extended mission.
 

  NASA wants a suit that can fit multiple users... A body, helmet, and interchangeable arms and legs, that can withstand weeks if not months of use in the lunar environment. The moon is one of the harshest environments possible... Forget the radiation, temperature (-200 to +200), and lack of gravity, it's the damn grit... Like glass that will cut everything.
 

  Just reading about how messed up the suit parts that came back from Apollo missions were is enough to give you the willies at how close to failure the suits were after the abuse they took.

  It is meant to be a point in space where the gravity of everything around it (e.g. earth, sun, etc) is all equal, so that overall, there is no acceleration of the object and it just dangles in space in the same position relative to something, rather than moving.

  The chimney is there to generate draft. As hot air rises up through the chimney it will leave a void behind where fresh air is pushed into. The taller the chimney the more hot air is contained within it and the more draft it creates. So having a tall chimney means there will be a lot more draft which may be needed for bigger furnaces.

  Clocks are mechanisms/circuits that are designed to run at a fixed rate, and they are very good at that. There is only one, perfectly precise rate that is neither fast nor slow. It is impossible to hit this exactly, so every clock will be either fast or slow at a given moment. Most clocks are pretty damn close though, so you perhaps wouldn't notice.
 

  Think of it like this: there are an infinite number of fast or slow rates, but only one precisely correct rate.

  Its not that the matter travels faster than light. Space itself is expanding faster than light. The matter is moving at sub light speed but the distances between objects are increasing faster than the speed light is travelling. Its not intuitive but experiments show this to be true.

  Actually the expanse got it right. NASA itself noted that cuts and bruises tend not to heal until the astronauts are back planetside. It's why everything within the space station and space craft is carefully designed to be as low risk for such injuries as possible, but they do happen. When they do they are treated like you normally would but any open cut is left wrapped and the bandage acts like an artificial clot however the natural regeneration of tissue won't occur.
 

  NASA and various medical research scientists are working on ways to overcome the body's lack of healing response in 0g. One way is actually using very specific wavelengths of red light that encourage your cells to produce the appropriate pieces needed to heal.

  Wooden spoons are made of cellulose and its texture and fibres are super good at bursting bubbles that they touch. Put enough surfactant (soap) in the water and this doesn't work, but for the sort of stuff that you boil, there's not enough in there to prevent this from happening.
 

  When you lay a spoon on top of a pot and it starts to boil, any of the ""weak"" bubbles that touch it instantly burst. This creates a space that is still within the middle of the pot for other bubbles to move to. Since that space is lower than what is required for the bubbles to fall over the taller side of the pot, it sets up a cycle where any climbing bubbles move up and then to the centre of the pot where they burst. As a result the boiling mass of bubbles never gets high enough to tip over the pot's sides and go sssssssssssssssssss.

  Because automatic transmissions have torque converters. The torque converter multiplies the engine’s torque when there is a big difference between the engine’s speed and the transmission’s speed; this happens whenever you shift up a gear. A standard transmission vehicle with such widely spaced gears would risk stalling at each shift or need to excessively slip the clutch.

  It's instinctual.
 

  Birds reared in plastic containers build their own nests just fine. They need not ever see a nest to build one.
 

  Further, the nests they build don't necessarily model the nests their parents built. If a researcher provides a bird with only pink building materials, the chicks reared in that pink nest will choose brown materials over pink for their own nests, if they have a choice.
 

  There is an instinctual template, thank god. Imagine being compelled to build something but having no idea of what or how. Torture!
 

  That's not to say that birds are slaves to their instinctual templates. They gain experience over successive builds and make minor changes to the design and location.

Now if you keep dividing the interest periods in smaller and smaller units and reinvesting every time, you would be getting higher and higher returns.

  Short answer: mass bends space-time; light follows space-time.
 

  Longer answer:  a property of mass-energy is that it bends space-time. Not only does this manifest as apparent attraction between objects with mass, but it also changes the path light follows relative to an observer's point of view. From the light's perspective, it propagates uniformly in all directions. But when direction itself bends, to another observer the light follows an apparently circuitous path.

  We're not entirely certain about why you lose consciousness from a knockout blow, we think it has something to do with the force of the blow cutting off blood flow to the brain or compression of the brain stem. We know that professional boxers building up their shoulder/neck muscles somehow allows them to sustain harder blows to the head without being knocked out, we also know most knockouts come from a uppercut/jab to the jaw that causes the head to whip around quickly.
 

  Sorry this isn't the best answer, but most of it is still speculation. We can't exactly put someone in an fMRI then hit them really hard in the head.

  You know how you can look at a soda bottle and there's no bubbles, and then you pop the top and the bubbles start rushing out.  It's like that with nitrogen in scuba divers.  If they rushed to the surface, all those bubbles would appear.
 

  Now crack the soda bottle very very slowly, slow enough that by the time it's open all the way, it's ""flat"".  That's a scuba divers decompression stop.
 

  Nitrogen builds up in your bloodstream at depth because each breath is compressed air containing lots of compressed nitrogen that gets mixed in your blood as miniscule bubbles.  Those bubbles get big when you have less pressure around them.
 

  With Free Divers, they only take one breath. That breath then compresses as they go down to depth, then back up.  All the dissolved nitrogen bubbles start small, get smaller at depth, then come back to small.

  Spinning the object will ensure that the drilled hole will be exactly concentric to the axis of rotation. When using a lathe, you often do multiple operations with the object, such as removing material from the sides of the object and then drilling a hole in the middle. Spinning the object ensures that any operation you do will be perfectly centered around the axis of rotation, allowing for extremely precise and symmetrical objects. You can easily create a perfect cylinder with a hole exactly in the middle. If you spun the drill bit then it would be very hard to center it precisely.

  The fish might weigh a lot, but if it’s not fighting then it’s no more difficult than pulling in a 500+pound log.
 

  Generally the fishing reel is set to allow the line to be pulled out if the fish pulls hard enough. That level is adjustable and the idea is to make it as difficult as possible to pull without breaking the line.
 

  In this way the fisherman is essentially trying to tire the fish out, until it doesn’t have the strength to pull away anymore.
 

  Once the fish is too exhausted to pull away, rather than trying to simply reel it in with a tiny handle the fisherman pulls the rod up to pull the fish closer then drops the point and wheels in the slack they’ve created before pulling the rod up again.
 

  This continues until the fish is close enough for a net or hook on a pole can be used to scoop the fish out.

  Non-rechargeable batteries are not “charged,” they’re simply constructed. Non-rechargeable batteries use a chemical reaction to generate an electrical potential. The chemical properties of the battery’s internal materials are therefore different before and after they are depleted. They are constructed with materials in their “pre-use” chemical state, which naturally form a voltage.
 

  Think of it this way: recharging batteries is like stretching a spring, storing energy within the system. Non-rechargeable batteries are like building a pre-tensioned spring, with the potential energy already in place. Once the energy is expended, the spring is collapsed, and you grab a new one.

  The proteins and carbohydrates in food are glue.
 

  Old-fashioned methods of making glue used the long protein molecules in animal products. Long molecules help the glue stick to itself and the surfaces. Modern glue contents don't differ much from the old fashioned contents.
 

  When you cook food too well, you evaporate the water  so the food glue hardens. The chemical reaction for glue to bind to a surface also increases with temperature. This caused the food to bind to metal and glass surfaces.
 

  Glassware in particular can absorb and hold more heat than it's metal equivalents (due to it's greater thickness). This means it can transfer a lot more heat and burn/glue food to it easier than metal.
 

  Nonstick surfaces do not react to form bonds with the food glue. That's what prevents the sticking.

  Neurosurgeon here. One of the most serious injuries after a head trauma is called an epidural hematoma (EDH). Basically a hemorrhage between the skull and the duramáter (a leather-like membrane that covers and protects the brain). In EDH there’s a phenomenon called a lucid period in which a person hits their head, briefly loses consciousness or has concussion-like symptoms only to be fully awake and aware for a brief period of time (therefore “lucid” period) and then loses consciousness again and quickly declines and dies shortly thereafter. If you go to sleep in that lucid period no one will notice you lose consciousness again (because you’re asleep) and then never wake up.
 

  Sleep does not do any harm, per se. It’s the fact that no one can tell you’re having any neurological deficit that quickly leads to long term problems and death

  Well the answer is logistics.
 

  If you have wheat just across the border why not import it. If the wheat is like on the other side of the country that's gonna be much more hassle to bring into the other parts of country.

  IMPORTANT NOTE!
 

  Thing are only transparent to SOME light. Glass for example is generally only transparent in the visible spectrum, it blocks infrared (and ultraviolet too, if I remember correctly).
 

  But other materials can be transparent to other light, that's literally how filters work.
 

  What is transparent to what light is purely dependent on whether that material's electrons can absorb the light. Why that happens isn't ELI5, because it has to do with energy levels of eletron orbitals. But if a material can't absorb that light, it basically doesn't exist for it.
 

  Metals can interact with almost all light because they have ""free electrons"". It's a property inherent to them being metals, and also why they conduct. You have to do extraordinary things to a metal to make it transparent.

  A blood test looks at the number of molecules or ions in a specified volume of blood.
 

  To get this information, you need to mix the blood with different chemicals to draw them out before processing them. This is why different blood bottles exist, because mixing with the wrong 'reagent' will produce errors.
 

  Even the most basic (common, not necessarily easiest) blood test like kidney function is still looking for four things: urea, creatinine, sodium and potassium. They all get processed off the same bottle helpfully, but if you wanted to do a full blood count (haemoglobin, white cells etc etc) that's a different bottle and will give you upwards of 8 different numbers depending on the lab.
 

  TL:DR - most blood tests are actually lots of results rolled into a list. There a far too many things in the blood to look for everything every time, it would cost tons.

  The mating seasons are an evolutionary adaption. It is better to have babies during certain parts of the year then others. It is very hard to find food during winter so raising a kid during winter may not be possible. So animals who get pregnant in time for birth during the spring have a much higher chance of these growing up and allow these genetic traits to continue.
 

  Animals who live in areas without big seasonal variations however do not have mating seasons as this does not give much of an advantage. Humans evolved in the African jungle and steppes and thus does not have mating seasons either. We have not lived long enough in the temperate areas to have developed mating seasons. Part of this might be that humans are very smart and resourceful and therefore have been able to save food and make comfortable shelters for the winter months, and even do more conscious family planning that does not rely on pure instincts.

  It's notorious for a couple of reasons.  One is that creating a firestorm in a city is more horrible than bombing the same city with explosives: the firestorm pulls in fuel and oxygen and expands, burning many people to death.
 

  The other thing it's notorious for is its use as an anti-personnel weapon dropped from the air.  That is, not being used to blow up buildings or tanks or munitions supplies, but specifically to burn people. It is liquid, so it can run under shelters, into tunnels, etc. It burns very hot  so you could be burnt to death even if you weren't physicaly hit with it.  And it's also sticky, so the person being burned can't scrape off the incredibly hot stuff burning through their skin.  During the Vietnam War, the US found that Vietnamese people were jumping into water to stop the burning so it was reformulated to stick to skin and continue burning under water.

  Short answer - they can and do.
 

  Longer answer - while blood transfusions take care of the acute problem, it's not a viable long-term solution; it is at best a temporary fix. Now, if the anemia is caused by sudden blood loss following an injury, that's fine and dandy, there shouldn't be a lasting issue at that point, but if you have some underlying condition causing the lack of blood iron, that will need to be treated, rather than merely topping up the red blood cells regularly. It can be likened with a serious oil leak in your car; pouring gallon after gallon of oil into it will keep it running, but it won't fix the problem, and it'll get ridiculously expensive in the long run for ultimately no benefit.

  The economy is manipulated to always have some level of inflation. The opposite, deflation, is very dangerous and the government will do anything to avoid it.
 

  Imagine wanting to buy new sofa that costs 1,000. Next month it will be 900. Month after it will be 700. Would you buy it now? Or would you wait and save 300 bucks?
 

  Deflation causes the economy to come to a screetching halt because people dont want to spend more than they need to, so they decide to save their money instead.
 

  Because of this, a small level of inflation is the healthiest spot for the economy to be in. Somewhere around 2% is generally considered healthy. This way people have a reason to buy things now instead of wait, but they also wont struggle to keep up with rising prices.

  Spark arrestors.  So, when you burn things, you can end up with flaming little embers escaping with the steam.  Those that exit out the chimney could land on brush near the train and start fires.  So chimneys had these little mesh grates called spark arrestors to catch the embers and hold them in place preventing them from escaping and causing fires.  But that causes a build up of residual material in the chimney, reducing pipe area, which reduced the exhaust and subsequent power of the engine.
 

  So those wide brimmed areas were designed to funnel the smoke, and the embers with them, to the side where the mesh grating would catch the embers and deposit in in the wider brim.  It'd have to be emptied out occasionally but prevented buildup in the main chimney chamber.
 

  It's basically a bucket to hold stuff to prevent fires while also not clogging the main exhaust.

  Your eyes and the area around them are pretty delicate and are filled with a lot of really small blood vessels that tend to break quite easily when you're tired or stressed out, so they leak blood into the skin around your eyes, which gives them the dark ""bruised"" look.
 

  When you go to sleep, your body uses way less energy than it normally does when you're up and about. Since your muscles are resting and your eyes are closed and everything's nice and relaxed, your body takes the time to get out its fixing toolbox and do repairs. Since you effectively don't use or need your eyes while you're asleep, your body will patch up the broken blood vessels around them, and the leaked blood gets broken down and cleaned up.

He assigned some camera’s an (easier) medium shot in which you have a broader view and the more experienced operators were assigned the close ups. Getting the close ups was hard. You focussed on a player that had the puck and when he swung to hit it you just guessed where it went. Sometimes you’d lose the puck entirely and then the director would instantly cut to the medium shot, allowing you to do a quick zoom out, find the puck and get a close shot again.

  Their bond is quite strong as its quite a stable relationship.
 

  Then comes the homewrecker called acid bringing their attractive ions along. Other couples are attracted to these ions more than their husband/wife therefore they dissolve. The bond in glass is too strong more most acids to break.

  For the most part, the healing was just your body doing its thing. The Neosporin contains several powerful antibiotics and antifungals which kill off anything which gets into the wound, allowing the body to spend its energy on healing instead of fighting an infection. In addition, the thick paste helps replace the natural barrier the skin provides, preventing the healing area from drying out and letting it heal more effectively.

  On a home automation or other “smart” device, there are two programs running at once, one program records a certain number of seconds on a loop, this recording is local only and runs all the time overwriting itself as it goes.
 

  A second program looks at the first program while it is running and if it detects the “wake” word it sends the snippet of voice to the cloud api to translate into an action.

And even though buildup of dangerous gasses is one of the reasons for these vents the biggest factor is humidity which will cause mold to grow and destroy the building.

  Fluorine is produced only through more unusual pathways, so it sits down in the 20s somewhere.
 

  It is actually more abundant in the earth’s crust than its concentration among the stars would suggest, probably because it is so furiously reactive and difficult to drive off.

  Because the singers are not synchronized on a fine scale and not spaced out taking the wavelength into account.

So you would get about 20 dB increase from 1 to 100.

  The leading theory (that I’m aware of from my neuropsych classes) is a misfiling of information into memory. Typically things flow from working memory > short term memory >  long term memory. Deja Vu appears to be information being filed from conscious awareness directly into long term memory, skipping working and short term. The experience is seeing something while simultaneously remembering it as though it happened before, with only a slight delay, which gives a confusing and unreal sensation.
 

  You ever notice how, if you try to remember exactly when it was you had already experienced the event, it seems to move from “wow this feels like it happened years ago… months! Maybe last week? Surely an hour?” Before the experience finally ends? That’s your brain correcting for the discrepancy, and literally moving it back into the right place (which is to say, real time, and no longer a memory).

 <p>
  The leading theory (that I’m aware of from my neuropsych classes) is a misfiling of information into memory. Typically things flow from working memory &gt; short term memory &gt;  long term memory. Deja Vu appears to be information being filed from conscious awareness directly into long term memory, skipping working and short term. The experience is seeing something while simultaneously remembering it as though it happened before, with only a slight delay, which gives a confusing and unreal sensation.
 </p>
 <p>
  You ever notice how, if you try to remember exactly when it was you had already experienced the event, it seems to move from “wow this feels like it happened years ago… months! Maybe last week? Surely an hour?” Before the experience finally ends? That’s your brain correcting for the discrepancy, and literally moving it back into the right place (which is to say, real time, and no longer a memory).

  The extensive tooth decay associated with methamphetamine use is caused by a combination of drug-induced psychological changes resulting in long periods of poor oral hygiene, and physiological changes resulting in dry mouth.
 

  In particular, dry mouth allows harmful acids, plaque, and food remnants to build up around the teeth, resulting in tooth decay. These would normally be continuously washed away by saliva, which protects against tooth decay.
 

  Methamphetamine itself is also acidic.

  Don't want to make light of or disregard your pain and experience, but what you are describing isn't really shock.
 

  Shock in medical terms is a condition brought on by a sudden drop in blood flow that leads to a general lack of oxygen supply to your body/organs. There are several causes for being in shock such as trauma, poisoning, infection, blood loss among others and it can be quite dangerous if untreated.

  In general all currencies float.  The market demand decides how many dollars you get for your euro, and so forth.
 

  Most central banks attempt to stabilize this float by buying the currency when it is low and selling it when it is high.  This buffering effect can keep the currency in a narrow trading range, if the central bank has enough money.
 

  Some of the time, like your Sri Lanka case, the central bank doesn't have enough money to keep the currency in the trading range.  At that time, they make an announcement that they are going to drop their support for the currency and let the market find it's own level.  This is typically much lower, and so everybody who has the currency will see their account values drop dramatically relative to a baseline currency like the dollar or euro.  That gets all the inflation out of the way, in one big painful event, rather than depressing everyone for months.

  We don't understand mental illness as well as we understand physical illness, because the mind is a much more complex system than most individual body systems. We have some theories, but for the most part mental health care is largely based on past trial-and-error to see what works.

  The problem is something called genomic imprinting. There are genes that are only expressed when they come a sperm or an egg. So if you take genes from two eggs you will have two sets of genes active or inactive when you should have one active and one inactive. That's bad and generally results in a dead embryo.

  With laughter it's important to understand it's a very deeply seated evolutionary mechanism to form social relationships. You can't force true laughter, and you laugh alone much less than in groups (approximately 97% less likely).
 

  Adults usually laugh at things that are amusing. However, babies primarily laugh during social interaction or when experiencing new things. Thus, it is likely to be an evolutionary benefits. The adult is flattered because they think the baby thinks they are funny. The baby laughs in order to illicit attention and learning from adults.

  ELI5 Answer: Think of an API like the controls to a car.  You've got a gas pedal to go forward, a brake pedal to stop, a steering wheel to turn, etc.  You've also got information about the car - how fast it's going (speedometer), how fast the engine is turning (tachometer), how much gas is in the tank, etc.
 

  You don't need to know
  
   how
  
  the gas pedal makes the car go forward or the details of how the fuel tank reads its level.  In fact, the 'under the hood' operation varies wildly from car to car, but since the car's interface is (roughly) the same, you can get in just about any car and drive it.
 

  The set of controls and information is like the car's API.  ""Turn this wheel to make the car go to the right.  Look here to see how fast you're going."" is like a website's API saying, ""Give me a string of text and the ID of a parent comment, and I'll post a reply to that comment"".

  Fat exists within fat cells. It is very much a normal thing for the contents of cells to be fluid, bad things can happen if they are not. Frostbite for example results in damage from ice crystals forming within cells which are normally full of liquid water. Cellular processes which involve moving materials between parts of the cell would become difficult to do if the interior of the cell was solid.
 

  So even if Wagyu fats are fluid at cow body temperature it isn't like the cow is going to melt or something. The cow is already composed of cells full of fluid.

Not everyone will see the benefit but when we test vehicles per the drive cycles, on average a vehicle can save something like 6% of fuel which is pretty significant. The vehicles are engineered not to turn off the engine under a certain temperature as the engine oil is thick and takes a lot of battery energy to start. There’s definitely a benefit for almost everyone with this small technology.

  Plants get tumors, but it's debatable whether they qualify as cancer.  Examples of a tumor on a plant include a burl or crown gall. The tumors are uncontrolled and abnormal growth of cells, which is one definition of cancer. But tumors don't spread throughout the body (called metastasizing) in plants like they do in humans because plant cells have cell walls that make the structure rigid and lock cells in place. Some definitions of cancer include that it spreads, so in that sense the term wouldn't apply.

  Reasonable doubt:
 

  A video shows someone who might be the defendant committing a crime.  However, the video is blurry and hard to make out.  It would be reasonable to question if this is enough evidence to convict.
 

  Beyond a reasonable doubt:
 

  A very high detailed video shows the defendant committing a crime.  The defendant's face is clearly shown and looks exactly like them.  The height, build, etc of the person in the video matches the defendant.  The defence though argued that maybe aliens cloned the defendant.  This claim gives doubt but without evidence of these aliens it isn't beyond a reasonable doubt.

  First, electricity is generated in many different ways. In some areas, large amounts of electricity come from non-greenhouse-gas sources, such as nuclear, hydroelectric, solar and wind, and more.
 

  Second, the way in which we harness the energy of burning fuel in an engine is very different to how we harness burning fuel in a power plant. Any power source will have an efficieny percentage of how much theoretical energy something produces, versus how much useful energy is created.
 

  Specifically, when you burn fuel in a car, you are using the explosive (kinetic) force of the fuel to push pistons out. However, a large amount of the energy in the reaction is lost as heat energy that doesn't have any practical use. Compared to an electric plant, we can capture extra heat and use that heat in sufficient quantities to spin a turbine to produce more electricity, increasing the overal efficiency.

  The same reason that a metal bar stays bent after someone bends it and lets go.
 

  The inside of a curve (unless it has thickness zero) is shorter than the outside of a curve. When you roll up a material tightly enough, you wind up stretching the outside curve of the material. When you then let it go, the outside is still stretched, having been permanently deformed, so the material stays curved/rolled up.
 

  How curved/rolled-up it stays depends on the material. Materials that are more elastic or flexible won't have been permanently deformed as much, and will return to their original shape. If you roll up solid wire, it'll stay rolled up. Paper will return more to its original form, but it'll keep some tendency to roll up to it.

  Oxygen travels significantly faster in wind than during stagnant ""diffusion"". Even if the wind is barely moving (1-2 meters per hour) then you will never experience a significant drop in oxygen, certainly not enough to cause any shortage that could impact your survival.
 

  Winds continually blow, such that in the middle of the Sahara desert, oxygen is still rounded off to 21% of air, which is the same as in the Amazon forest.
 

  Localised hotspots occur where lots of phytoplankton are living together, where it would be possible to measure 21.1-21.2% oxygen content in the localised air.

  Deep Freeze uses peppermint oil (previously levomenthol, but they reformulated due to changes in the law). This causes a sensation of coolness without an actual lowering in temperature. However the body reacts in a similar way, by reducing blood flow to the affected area, so it does cause a reduction in swelling similar to if an actual ice pack had been used.

  Mold spores are ubiquitous - they are pretty much everywhere.  Normal indoor spore count ranges from 500 to 5,000 spores per cubic meter, and outdoor spore counts can be as much as 50,000 spores per cubic meter in summer and fall in many areas.  Moldy buildings can have much higher spore counts, sometimes as high as 500,000 spores per cubic meter.  Since they're nearly everywhere, all it takes is the right environment for spores to sprout and become mold - just some water and organic material (like paper or wood or drywall).

  Lethal dosage is calculated in terms of the LD50. This is the dose that statistically should kill half of the test subjects it's administered to based on body weight.
 

  Since we obviously can't test lethality of something on humans, we use laboratory animals like mice whose biology is well known and can be compared to ours.
 

  Say you take a population of ten mice whose body weight is each 1kg. You find out after repeated trials that it takes a dose of 100mg to kill an average of five mice each time. This means the LD50 of the poison is 100mg/kg.
 

  Scaling that up, we can say it would statistically take a 10,000mg dose to kill half of a population of 100kg humans. That would be about ten grams of poison, which isn't terribly toxic. One of the most potent toxins on earth- botulinum- has an LD50 in the nanogram (1 billionth of a gram) range.

  It’s for leverage. If power steering fails, you’ll be able to turn easily if the steering wheel is in the horizontal plane. Notice how they are bigger for this reason. The simplicity in design other comments suggest it’s just a bonus, one extra joint it’s not big deal nowadays.

  Because the soda you get form a machine isn’t quite the same as the soda from the bottle.
 

  Restaurants get packs of the soda syrup that they hook up to the machine, which the machine then mixes with water and adds the carbonation right then and there as you push the lever.  This means that the carbonation is less throughly mixed/dissolved in the soda. There is less carbonation in soda from the machine than bottled soda.

  I had this explanation years ago, I can’t find the exact reference, but this will help-
 

  Why 360 degrees? Probably because old calendars (such as the Persian Calendar) used 360 days for a year - when they watched the stars they saw them revolve around the North Star one degree per day.
 

  Also 360 can be divided exactly by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 45, 60, 72, 90, 120 and 180, which makes a lot of basic geometry easier.

As harsh as they are, they would never allow something seriously dangerous to happen to a private (at least mine wouldn't), so I reloaded and fired. I'd like to say I noticed a cool eruption of mud come out of the barrel, but honestly it was like nothing was different. The M16 cycled flawlessly like every other round.

  A molecule is not required to share any characteristics whatsoever with the atoms it's made up from.

  As for the combination of the gasses, no, oxygen and hydrogen won't spontaneously condense into water if you mix them together. You need something to spark the reaction--literally, in this case; a spark or flame will heat the gas mixture enough to start the reaction going, and since the reaction is exothermic (produces heat) then it will keep going once started until all reactants are consumed. The practical upshot of this is, if you have hydrogen and oxygen mixed together in their ideal 2:1 ratio and you apply a spark, the whole lot will blow up in your face producing hot water (e.g. steam) as the product.

  As the water/rice mixture is heated, that heat energy increases the temperature of the mixture until it reaches 100 C. At that point, the additional energy will convert the water to steam and the temperature will remain at 100 C. Once all the water boils away (which is when the rice is done), the energy will then start to raise the temperature of the cooked rice above 100 C. So the rice cooker just needs to sense when the temperature goes above 100 C and shut off. This is usually done with a metal strip that expands/bends as it heats, and when it reaches a temperature a little over 100 C, the metal strip bends enough to close a circuit and shut off the heat.

  Horses and donkeys have a different number of chromosomes. Specifically, horses have 64 chromosomes and donkeys have 62. During sexual reproduction the chromosomes are split in half and the offspring gets one half from each parent to make the full set. So, the horse donates 32 chromosomes and the donkey donates 31.
 

  That means the mule has 63.You may notice that 63 is an odd number. The genes in the chromosomes are similar

  match up correctly because of the odd numbered split. Without matching correctly, they can't be activated correctly and the offspring will fail to develop.

Have we always had that trait, effects it had historically and the reasons for it?</p>",7245,h8lkv28,"

  So a lot of diseases associated with inbreeding are caused by what are known as recessive genes.  With a recessive gene you need to get that recessive gene from both parents to fully express it.  Having just one copy from one parent will mean that the other parent's dominant gene will override the recessive gene (or at least make it not express as badly).
 

  So, just so we're clear, inbreeding doesn't create recessive genes.  What happens is that if a family has a recessive gene that is bad then there's a higher chance of it being passed on through the generations and if the inbreeding is high enough then you can get to the point where everyone has 2 copies of the recessive gene and so it just keeps getting passed on and expressed.  You see it in history with a lot of royal families as they quite often were quite inbred.
 

  Also......... all breeding is inbreeding, it's just to what degree.  Remember, we're all related.

  So you have a bunch of data, and you would like to put a line through it. The problem is that your data doesn't sit on a line. So instead you just pick a line that gets as close to all your data points as possible. This is a linear regression.
 

  Some of your points won't be on that line. The difference between a data point and the line is called the error. When you have a computer do this it's going to select a line that minimizes the overall error.
 

  Depending on your data this might work really well and it might not. The R-squared value is just a way of determining how well the line fits the data. If you have a R-squared value close to one, then you have a really good line. If you have an R-squared value close to zero, then your data is totally random and can't be fit to a line.

  Google can then crunch all that position data and come up with average speeds, which become a fairly good proxy for traffic. Too, people tend to report traffic accidents on Google Maps, and there are probably other sources Google ingests from.

  To make their hooves last longer on tough surfaces like pavement, bricks etc.
 

  Horses hooves are very similar to our fingernails. In fact, you can consider that horses are essentially walking on their fingertips and a hoof is just a really big thick fingernail at the end of essentially their middle finger. The hoof material grows somewhat quickly but in nature, the horse is constantly moving over dirt, rocks, sand etc. so their hooves get naturally abraded.
 

  For working horses they're on roads, sidewalks, paved stable floors - those surfaces would wear down the hoof material a lot quicker than in nature so we put horseshoes on to protect them. The downside of course is since the hoof isn't being worn down naturally at all, every few months you have to have the farrier come out and re-shoe them. Basically, tear the old shoe out, trim, give the hoof a manicure/pedicure, put a new shoe back on.

  It can. If your eye is damaged, it will at least try to repair itself. Lenses are usually left foggy afterward, as scar tissue does not play nice with the optically smooth surface needed for a good lens.

  Archaeologist here. There’s a lot of reasons. Some have already been mentioned. When buildings collapse it makes a lot of rubble and dust that can cover other ruins. You also have floods, volcanic eruptions, dust storms, etc. Other factors can be plants…over thousands of years plants grow on ruins, die, and decay and this produces a lot of soil that can bury things. People also often throw trash into abandoned buildings, over time this builds up and can bury a whole structure. Last, don’t forget deliberate burial in old cities. It’s easier to just fill in the foundations of an old structure with dirt and build on top of it, rather than tear the whole thing down. Same with streets, if you need to replace a street, just cover it with some dirt and pave it fresh on top. Over time this can add many layers on top of one another.

  With a non serrated knife the edge of the blade gets worked hard against cutting boards which blunts them over time.
 

  With a serrated blade there’s a large part of the blade that never makes contact with the chopping board because it’s recessed, so this part stays sharp for longer because it only makes contact with softer things like fruit and veg.
 

  It’s a bit like why your finger tips get sore and damaged when you’re working, but in between your fingers where they join your hands rarely get sore and damaged.
 

  The other reason is because a serrated edge produces a sawing action and not a slicing action so the cut is actually done differently. In your example of cutting bread, a sawing action will cut through the crust much more easily than even a brand new slicing knife.

  When a women becomes pregnant, her body starts produced tons of hormones to prepare her body to sustain and carry the child. Some of these hormones will begin to collect in the woman's urine with days or weeks of fertilization.
 

  The tests work by triggering a two phase chemical reaction. The first reaction basically just detects water, that's the first, ""not pregnant"" line. The second stripe contains a chemical that changes color when it reacts with the hormones, but it takes more time. Think of it this way, there's a ton of water in pee so that's easy to detect, there's only a tiny bit of hormones so they're harder to find.
