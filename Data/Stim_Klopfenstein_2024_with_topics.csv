  Strata.
 

  What's on top of the writing?  What's below it?  What ink was used?  How old is the wood found above it?  How long are the stalactites around it or over it?
 

  Everything in terms of data has to do with determining a window of time, not an exact time, given what you know must have occurred earlier and what must have occurred later.  If they're using a particular ink that isn't in common use until a certain date, and that date was itself determined by an example over which a tree grew or a stalactite formed.  And you can date that tree or stalactite, which gives you an upper or lower bound on the date.
 

  Strata, layers.  It must have happened AFTER this but BEFORE this, and you compare against databases over thousands of sites to check it's all consistent.

  The cortical reaction! 
To ELI5 it:
First, you need to know that egg cells are surrounded by a thick layer of jelly-like goop (Zona Pellucida) Sperm cells have to burrow through that goop to actually reach the egg itself. The first sperm to make it through the goop to the egg sends its genetic information into the egg cell. This triggers a kind of intruder alarm, which releases chemicals (enzymes) that turn the jelly-goop into a hard, thick shell. Any sperm that was still in the goop is now trapped, and any sperm that is late to the party has found the door closed. This makes sure that only one sperm can actually make it to the egg.

  An acid burn results in something called coagulative necrosis, which basically means it kills the cells but leaves their bodies behind in a mushy layer. This new mushy layer actually can prevent the acid from penetrating into deeper tissues and causing more damage.
 

  An alkali (base) burn results in liquefactive necrosis, which means that it melts your cells and clears the way to your spongy insides to do more damage.
 

  The difference is that acid reacts with proteins and base will react with fats.

  The chemicals in your eyes are only sensitive to narrow wavelengths of visual light.  Anything outside that is invisible to us.
 

  You can not, for example, see the infrared light emitted by your TV remote. But your phone camera can, to a certain degree. Go into a dark room, point your TV remote at your phone camera, and you should see it light up.
 

  Same thing with sound. Your eardrum and middle ear bones are only able to resonate within a certain frequency range. Go above and the bones are too heavy to move that quickly, go below and the eardrum is too small to be put in motion by such a long wavelength.

  When you're in a stressful situation, your brain secretes chemicals called ""adrenaline"" and ""cortisol"" into your blood.

  I live in a condo. In Europe. There are 150 condos in this building, and nearby there are other similar buildings. Typical ugly blocks of flats build during the ""Socialistic era"". We have central heating and it also provides hot water for each and every flat. Hot water never, ever runs out. There is central heating plant in town and it supplies hot water for all big buildings. There is a ""thermal substation"" in each neighborhood where the heat is supplied centrally from the power plant and they heat water for all buildings in a borough.
 

  New York has similar system, I think, with distribution of steam all around city center.

  File compression saves hard drive space by removing redundant data.
 

  For example take a 500 page book and scan through it to find the 3 most commonly used words.
 

  Then replace those words with place holders so 'the' becomes $, etc
 

  Put an index at the front of the book that translates those symbols to words.
 

  Now the book contains exactly the same information as before, but now it's a couple dozen pages shorter. This is the basics of how file compression works. You find duplicate data in a file and replace it with pointers.
 

  The upside is reduced space usage, the downside is your processor has to work harder to

  The entire radio spectrum is ""noisy""--there's interference in it from both man-made sources and natural ones (e.g. lightning strikes). If you tune the radio to a dead channel then all it will be picking up is that noise, which it amplifies and turns into the static that you hear. You still get the noise on actual radio channels, but it gets drowned out by the radio station you're tuned in to so you tend not to notice unless it's very bad.

  A couple of different reasons, not the least of which being a denser but softer metal will do more damage when it hits a soft target.  Another reason is that lead has a much lower melting point than, say, iron or steel, so anyone could make their own musket balls back in the day.
 

  But a big reason these days is because you want a softer material than steel as your bullets to keep from damaging the barrel, especially if the barrel is rifled.  Lead and copper won't cut into rifling grooves, while steel will wear them down over time.

  When the OS is first started, it's in a 'clean' state where everything is configured and working properly. All the services are in place, all the connections are set up, everything is green.
 

  As the OS works, over time it might encounter problems. There might be errors. Some of those can be easily recovered from, some not. Some of them don't cause any problems, some of them interfere with the router's function, slowing it down or outright preventing it from doing its thing. Restarting the router returns the OS to that initial clean state where everything is working again.

  Early jet engines were actually quite inefficient compared to what we have today. Not painting the exterior was one way to shave off a surprising amount of unnecessary weight and thus save fuel and increase payload. Paint is surprisingly heavy and, while this was primarily done to military aircraft, the weight saving on commercial passenger jets was considerable, think 100s of kg each.
 

  The trade off. Of course, was that this increased maintenance costs but as early jet aircraft had fairly simple airframes this was acceptable. Modern airframes are considerably more complex and whilst less easy to damage they are much more expensive to maintain. This flips the trade off firmly in favour of pained exteriors in every case.

Paracetamol is an old drug that's been used for decades, we know all the side effects, we know what groups can take it and what groups can't. If it were invented today would it pass regulators with this discrepancy? Probably but it would be harder and probably more tightly controlled and not sold in most shops.

  We do know how it works, there's just debate over which receptor site in particular it uses. Paracetamol is an old drug that's been used for decades, we know all the side effects, we know what groups can take it and what groups can't. If it were invented today would it pass regulators with this discrepancy? Probably but it would be harder and probably more tightly controlled and not sold in most shops. We still don't know fully how anaesthetics and hypnotic drugs work. We just know that they do.

  If you'd leave the cutting in the same water for some time, the water will get depleted of oxygen, bacteria and fungi will grow and it would infect the cutting. So, essentially the same thing as with root rot in soil would happen.
 

  The difference to a hydroponic system (as others already pointed out), is that the water in a hydro system is constantly agitated (with pumps, bubblers etc.) and thus enriched with oxygen. This way the water doesn't get ""stale"" and harmful microorganism won't grow.

  The reason Botox treatment doesn't kill you is because they don't inject enough to kill you. It's still toxic, it works by paralyzing the targeted muscles, but the dose is small enough that some muscle paralysis is (hopefully) the only bad effect.

  There is a lot of interesting stuff that the human eye can't see. A billowing nebula of hydrogen and helium gas slowly collapsing to form a new star is really cool!
 

  But, it would be too dim for the human eye to see so it would just be black. So we up the brightness. But also the human eye can't see sparse gas against vacuum, and it can't see the frequencies of light required to distinguish between hydrogen and helium. So we shift the frequency into something in visible light, effectively picking a color to represent each gas.
 

  At the end you have an image that doesn't really represent what the naked eye could view. But it would also be pretty silly to say ""Check out this image from my infrared camera!"" and hand you a blank sheet of paper because you can't see infrared light.

  This is the same as 99*a + a + 9*b + b + c
 

  Obviously 99a and 9b are both divisible by 3.
 

  Which, in order for there not to be a remainder, requires a+b+c be divisible by 3 - i.e. the sum of the digits to be divisible by 3 - for the number to be divisible by 3.
 

  You can see how you can extrapolate this to any number of digits.

  Both these words come from Old English. They were written as “hus” and “mus” back then, and the plurals were “hus” and “mys”. That is, the plural for “hus” was the same as singular, while the plural for “mus” changed the vowel. This difference in plurals is due to the fact that Old English was a gendered language, and while “mus” was a feminine noun (basically like we call a ship “she” today), “hus” was neuter. Nouns of different gender had different plural formation rules. Eventually English invented the new plural formation rule (by adding -s at the end of a word), but didn’t apply it to some feminine nouns like “mus”/“mouse” which retained their old plurals. Then English nouns lost their gender, and the vowels in words changed rather uniformly during the linguistic event called “The Great Vowel Shift”.

  They can. But only at very specific spots and, since your ears capture sound over an area, they can't completely make you not hear it.
 

  If you have a pure sine wave signal (a pure tone) and broadcast the exact opposite, you will indeed cancel to exactly zero wherever the loudness (amplitude) and alignement (phase) of the reversed wave exactly opposes the incoming wave. Assuming that the cancelling signal is louder than the incoming signal, this will always happen *somewhere*. But it'll be a very small region.
 

  Your eardrum is a whole area so you can't cancel the incoming signal across your whole ear, so some will get through, so you'll always hear some of it.

  Hurricanes need to form over very warm ocean water. Looking at a
  map of world ocean currents
  , you can see that the areas known to form hurricanes (South-East coast of North America and South-East Asia) lie right in the path of warm ocean currents bringing water directly up from the equator.
 

  Europe on the other hand mostly gets tepid water from the North Atlantic Drift - not enough thermal energy to generate storms of that type. The ""hot"" water of the gulfstream makes big storms around Cuba and Florida, goes up the east coast of USA, then the ""spent"" system drifts across the Atlantic to Europe.

  Running cable underground is more expensive typically and can be more difficult to install / replace if damaged. But in theory it's a great idea for areas which are prone to high winds. Underground cable can have a lifetime of around 40 years in the service, often exceeding this so a slow but sure rollout of an underground cable network can work well for future proofing too. Although in some cases it's likely that it isn't feasible, either economically or construction wise due to difficult sub surface terrain etc.

  I haven't seen any explanations that answer the actual question, and as an aerospace engineer and car enthusiast, I'm gonna change that.
 

  Larger tires DON'T provide more grip. Due to the increased weight, they ALSO slow you down.
 

  So why are they used?
 

  Because the amount of friction sticky tire compounds provide is larger than a small tire's shear failure point.
 

  Bits of tire are always left behind, but you'd be leaving actual chunks if your tires weren't larger.
 

  Maximum shear is directly proportional to area. Wider tire? More area for the shear.
 

  The effect of not overpowering the tire's failure modes means you can effectively have more grip. You can get more of that friction into something usable, which means you can handle and accelerate harder.

  Now imagine that the on/off state is not controlled by a mechanical switch being moved by your finger, but instead it is controlled by the presence or absence of a few electrons that can be deposited or removed from the switch.
 

  Each switch can represent a single bit of information. An SD card has billions of these tiny switches that can be turned on or off.
 

  In the latest technology each switch is more like a dimmer that be controlled in steps of 1/8 of the full brightness of the switch. This allows us to store 3 bits instead of just one.

  Celtic is a Latin word (Celtae) from Greek (Κελτοί—Keltoi). In classical Latin, all Cs are hard. However, later forms of Latin (e.g. ecclesiastical Latin) softened the C. So a name like Caesar pronounced in classical Latin is Kaesar while in ecclesiastical Latin it is pronounced Saesar.
 

  For whatever reasons, the basketball team decided to use the ecclesiastical pronunciation. Modern English typically does, and perhaps more so back in the 1940s when the team was founded. However, people instead chose to use the classical pronunciation when referring to the linguistic group of people. Perhaps they wanted that name to reflect what the Romans that named them. If there is an exact socio-cultural reason aside form arbitrary choice, I am not familiar with it. Perhaps an etymologist or linguist can chime in and some more history behind this.

  I often color old black-and-white photographs as a hobby and, most of the time, you just have to guess when you colorize an image.
 

  Sometimes, for famous people, you can do historical research to find out the color of their hair and eyes or even their homes' furnishings (for instance, Empress Alexandra Feodorovna had reddish gold hair and blue eyes and her mauve boudoir was all lavender with pistachio green carpets). You can also do research to get a general idea of the kinds of colors that were popular, say, in the Victorian or Edwardian eras... but that's pretty much it.

  Different chemicals do different things. The chemicals in ""disposable"" batteries (""single-use"" is a better term) react once (albeit over a long period of time), then the products of the reaction are no longer able to be used. (The reaction is not ""reversible"".)

  There are two big problems we face here.
 

  The first is that lightning is unpredictable - we would be investing in a system that might occasionally help, but equally might do next to nothing for long periods and overall end up costing money to maintain without generating many gains.
 

  The second is that we just don't really have the technology to capture and store that amount of electricity quickly enough. Those car batteries that take 20 minutes to charge with a fast charger?

  Wood isn't just a single thing. It's lots of things. There are oils and water and other things than just carbon. And those other things don't burn very well.*
 

  Charcoal is made by heating wood in a low or no oxygen environment. The lack of oxygen prevents it from burning, while the heat causes things like water to evaporate and leave.
 

  What you are left with is basically pure carbon which will burn much more efficiently with all those other impurities removed.

  Fusing large atoms or splitting small ones does not release energy, but actually absorbs energy.

  Finally a comment I can talk about!
 

  I am a gastroenterologist. The prep you take works by pushing stool out mechanically. Much like a drano does with a clog.
 

  However polyethylene glycol (and most osmotic laxatives) also prevents the absorption of water by your large intestine. So all that liquid that you drink stays inside the intestine and causes diarrhea rather than excessive urination.
 

  On a side note, Make sure to take your prep until the stool is consistently water and fairly clear. In adults if you aren’t cleaned out there is no point in doing the colonoscopy (particularly if they are looking for cancer) so you will have to go through the process again.

  Headache pain results from nerves sending pain signals to the brain; the exact nature depends on the kind of headache, but the most common are:
 


   Tension headaches. No single cause, but in some people they tend to originate in tightened muscles in the back of the neck and scalp. There are two types: episodic (fewer than 15 days per month) and chronic (more than 15 days)
  

   Migraine. The cause of these is not yet known, but is believed to be linked to changes in the brain and genetic factors. Currently the best guess is that overactive nerve cells send out a signal that triggers the trigeminal nerve, triggering the release of chemicals that cause your brain lining's blood vessels to swell.
  

   Cluster. Similar to migraine. They're more common in smokers or heavy drinkers. They also reach their full force a lot more quickly, and are somewhat predictable based on your body clock.

  Afaik the answer to this is not fully known, but we know that a combination of factors are involved:
 



    Bats are capable of distinguishing between their own 'voice' and that of others, similar to how we can. Hearing their own voice is far more disorienting than hearing others' voices.
   



    The brain is capable of rejecting information from sources that wildly contradicts its current world model.

  Swelling results from capillary leakage, which itself results from the release of inflammatory compounds at the site of injury.  The fluid can become what's called organized, in which proteins in the fluid, like fibrin, accumulate, and this can make the swelling permanent to some degree.  Does the swelling serve any purpose?  The capillary leakage also lets white blood cells into the damaged area, and these control infection and gobble up debris (by Pac Man-type cells called macrophages) from the injury, so I think the answer is yes.  But getting rid of the swelling within a week is a good idea, as the infection control and gobbling up of debris is done by that time as well.

  Eye color=what kind of colored stuff is in the eye+how the eye scatters light. The first part is easy. The human body makes melanin, the same pigment that determines skin color, and the iris of your eye has more or less of it. Lots of melanin=brown or black eyes, end of story. There are other pigments that can contribute to amber or dark green eyes.
 

  The other part is weirder. It comes down to how light is scattered by fibers in the iris. This is the same kind of physics that explains why the sky is blue, why skim milk looks kinda blue, or why some bird feathers are colorful even though they don't have any coloring in them. If there's not much melanin or other pigment, then this explains more of the lighter colors like blue and green.

  Ice cores. Where you drill a big hole in the ice and pull out samples.
 

  When Ice freezes, it traps tons of little air bubbles in it. These little air bubbles have the same composition of the overall atmosphere when that sections of ice froze.
 

  So, if you were to go somewhere like Antarctica, and drill down hundreds of feet, you would get to ice that formed a long long time ago, thousands and even hundreds of thousands of years for the deepest cores.
 

  You now have ice that froze a long time ago, and trapped a sample of the atmosphere from that time in it. You have a sample literally frozen in time.
 

  You can then take that to a lab and do an analysis of how much CO2, Methane, O2, and other gasses are present and compare that to levels we see today and from other younger or older ice cores.

 <p>
  Trucks are
  <em>
   heavy
  </em>
  . Driving downhill means the brakes need to constantly be slowing down their heavy loads, building up heat in the brakes. Unfortunately brakes become less effective as they get hot, meaning longer periods of braking are required which makes them
  <em>
   more
  </em>
  hot, etc.

  You need to distinguish between heat and temperature to understand this.  The sun radiates energy, but it doesn't contribute to an increase in temperature until it hits something and warms that something up.  Because there is nothing in between the sun and the earth, it is ""cold"".  But if you were floating there, with the sun full on you, it would heat you up.  They need to put reflective foil on spacecraft for this reason.  In the shade of something, your body would radiate heat, which would make you very cold.

  Voltage isn't exactly constant.  A cell phone battery might be rated at 3.7 volts, but really it's 3.8V when it's fully charged, and 3.5V when it's empty.
 

  The phone then has (more or less) a look-up table.  The phone knows that when it's at 3.8V, it's 100% charged.  And when it's at 3.75V it's 80% charged, etc.  This is also why old phones sometimes go from 20% charged to 0% charged almost instantly - because the battery is old and isn't performing according to the lookup table.

  The vast majority of the energy that a dishwasher uses goes towards heating the water. The sprayer pumps use very little power in comparison.
 

  So the best way to reduce the overall energy consumption is to lower the water temperature, which makes the cleaning cycle take longer, but that's fine because only the low power pumps are running during that time.

  The brain of the bird is made to mostly perceive movements (like the raptors in Jurassic Park). So in order to see those movements they try to stay still most of the time. When they have to move, they will move most of their body and keep the head at the same place so that they can still perceive movement in reference to them. Then they will quickly readjust when they can't do that anymore, giving that weird look when they do.

  A big part has to do with the human body being very energy efficient. Muscle tissue eats up a lot of calories. When you are inactive for extended periods of time, your body decreases your muscle volume because there’s no reason to burn the extra calories to sustain it. Your lung capacity also goes down and your heart becomes weaker, decreasing the oxygen intake that powers your bodily functions.
 

  There’s also a good chance you’re eating poorly and/or eating too much, so you’re packing on the fat and losing nutrients, which adds on weight that you no longer have muscles to support and throws off your body chemistry.
 

  The next time you try to be active, even doing small things like walking across the room, you get tired much faster.
 

  There’s also a lot of changes in brain chemistry and oversleeping messes with your circadian rhythm, but I’m not entirely confident in explaining that.

  When water boils, it's getting so hot that parts of it are becoming a gas, pushing the rest of the water away and rising up in bubbles to escape as steam.
 

  As you heat a pot of water from the bottom, the bottom layers get hot enough to boil first. Bubbles of steam form and rise into the relatively cooler water. Here the steam cools and loses energy until it can no longer hold the water apart anymore to form a bubble. Suddenly the bubble collapses as the water slams down around it.
 

  This is the loud sound you hear, and it goes away once the water is heated throughout and the bubbles can pass through it to escape by popping more quietly at the surface.
 

  If you stir a pot of boiling water vigorously as it heats up, you can get rid of this loud phase of boiling.

  One theory that I like says that the reason for the universe's expansion is that dark energy is a fundamental property of spacetime. It's the nature of space to grow, and as it does, there exists more space which also has its own dark energy.
 

  In this way, space expands faster and faster as more space comes into existence. It increases in volume forever while all the matter and energy inside is gradually pulled apart.

  Yes, they do have explosives strapped to the exterior! It's called. Explosive reactive armor. Anti-tank weapons most often employ what is called a shaped charge, which is an explosive device that is shaped in a way to focus the blast energy. Think of it like using a magnifying glass to burn paper, focusing the energy in one small area increases the penetrative power of the Anti-tank weapon. To counteract shaped charges, explosive reactive armor is deployed. The explosive reactive armor detonated when hit, and the shock wave disrupts the focused energy of the shaped charge. While yes this obviously causes some minimal damage to the exterior of the tank, it provides far greater protection than not having it. Also, it allows the tanks to be lighter, move faster, and this be harder to hit

To counteract shaped charges, explosive reactive armor is deployed. The explosive reactive armor detonated when hit, and the shock wave disrupts the focused energy of the shaped charge. While yes this obviously causes some minimal damage to the exterior of the tank, it provides far greater protection than not having it. Also, it allows the tanks to be lighter, move faster, and this be harder to hit

  Concrete is good in compression, but terrible in tension- it’s relatively weak and when it fails it normally fails by snapping without any warning.
 

  Steel is good in tension - it has a high tensile strength and when it fails it stretches for a bit first, so you see things bending and sagging in a bad way before it falls down, giving you time to GTFO.
 

  So you can take a concrete beam/slab and stick steel bars in the areas that are going to be in tension. When you load up the beams/floors the concrete cracks a little and then the steel carries the tension.
 

  This lets you have a structure with the concrete working in compression, which it is good at, and the steel working in tension, which it is good at.

  Passenger aircraft fly around 85% the speed of sound.
 

  To go much faster you have to break the sound barrier, ramming through the air faster than it can get out of the way.  This fundamentally changes the aerodynamic behavior of the entire system, demanding a much different aircraft design - and much more fuel.
 

  We know how to do it, and the Concorde did for a while, but it’s simply too expensive to run specialized supersonic aircraft for mass transit.

  Water is an excellent heat sink - it absorbs tons of heat during the day and then releases it at night, cooling the days and warming the nights in most of the world.
 

  But what if you have no water?  No lakes, oceans, puddles, or even plants with water in them?
 

  Then you’re relying on the much lower heat capacity of sand, barely 1/5th that of water.  This leads to wild temperature swings as the sun boils the surface during the day and all the heat escapes into cloudless nights.
